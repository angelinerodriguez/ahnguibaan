Let first say, I'm a huge Omega Mark. He's easily my favourite wrestler of all time and I've been watching live since 2004, and have seen most of the old WWF dating back to the 80's. Even though I prefer New Japan over WWE, I have literally no interest in AEW. I used to love BTE, but I got really sick of it, and got pretty tired of guys like Cody and Hangman. Even the Young Bucks, who are still very entertaining wrestlers grew weary on me. But I still love Kenny. I feel like the only reason.
